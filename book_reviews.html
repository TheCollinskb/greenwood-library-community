                <h3>"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald</h3>
                <p><strong>Reviewed by:</strong> John Doe</p>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆ (4/5)</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> "The Great Gatsby is a powerful exploration of the American Dream and the decadence of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's prose is poetic and the themes are still relevant today, making it a timeless classic."</p>

                <h3>"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee</h3>
                <p><strong>Reviewed by:</strong> Jane Smith</p>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★★ (5/5)</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> "This novel is a masterpiece of empathy and moral growth. Set in the deep South during the 1930s, it deals with racism, justice, and growing up in a way that is both heartbreaking and inspiring."</p>

                <h3>"1984" by George Orwell</h3>
                <p><strong>Reviewed by:</strong> Emily Green</p>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★★ (5/5)</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> "1984 is as unsettling today as it was when it was first published. Orwell's chilling vision of a totalitarian state is a stark warning about the dangers of surveillance and loss of individual freedoms."</p>
